				<h3>Bridge <span>Monitoring</span></h3>
				<p>Pulling ﬁber cables on the bridge is often not an economical approach. EtherWAN Ethernet extenders provide other options, allowing existing coax or telephone lines to be used. When used together with PoE solutions, their implementation is ideal in terms of cost and performance. Whether it is upgrading the network infrastructure on an existing bridge, or building a system for a new bridge, EtherWAN has both the product range and the application experience to meet any project needs in terms of cost and performance.</p>

				<h3>Highway <span>Safety</span></h3>
				<p>Digital devices are now found on all modern highways and gantries. These include electronic tolling systems, emergency reporting systems, traﬃc ﬂow detectors, and weather sensors. The network that connects these devices must be able to operate in a wide temperature range, and handle full data loading for long periods. EtherWAN's hardened-grade equipment plays a vital role in many major highway management networks around the world.</p>

				<h3>Metro <span>Transit</span></h3>
				<p>The New York transit system planned to upgrade its analog intercom systems to IP. In order to build up a fully integrated system, the intercom company collaborated with EtherWAN on the project, from system design to technical support. EtherWAN provided a special 16 port DIN rail PoE solution that was only 1/2 the size of comparable products that satisﬁed the space, performance and power requirements of the new system. The resulting outcome was a great success.</p>

				<h3>Tunnel <span>Monitoring</span></h3>
				<p>For pedestrian and vehicular tunnels, ITS systems must be robust and absolutely reliable. For safety, devices should be grouped in subnets, so Layer 3 functionality is needed. EtherWAN provided one German city with a hardened tunnel solution that not only connects digital signage, CO2 monitors, a host of IP cameras, and programmable logic controllers (PLCs), but also provides routing between the many subnets.<br /><br /></p>

		<h3>Intersection <span>Surveillance</span></h3>
		<p>A city with a population of over two million came to the conclusion that it was time to upgrade their city-wide traﬃc video surveillance from analog to digital. EtherWAN resolved the many issues in this complicated project with a combination of traditional network topology and proprietary know-how, including the ability to deliver PoE power to distances of up to 250 meters.</p>
